# Numpy

# Q1: Given a 2D NumPy array A of shape (5, 5), subtract the mean of each row from every element in that row without using a loop.
# Q2: You have a NumPy array of integers from 1 to 1000. Return a new array containing only the numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 7 but not by 5.
# Q3: Create an 8x8 NumPy array with a chessboard pattern (alternating 0s and 1s), where the top-left element is 0.

# Pandas (Create a DataFrame with the specified columns and perform the operations)

# Q1: Given a DataFrame df with columns: ["department", "employee", "salary"], normalize the salary within each department (i.e., for each department, subtract the mean and divide by the std of that department).
# Q2: Given a DataFrame with columns ["timestamp", "user_id", "action"], where timestamp is in string format, find the average number of actions per user per day.
# Q3: You have a DataFrame with columns: ["user_id", "product", "price", "quantity", "date"]. Calculate the total amount spent by each user on "Laptop" purchases only, and return the result as a new DataFrame with columns: ["user_id", "total_spent_on_laptops"].
